## Running the Application
To run the application, navigate to the directory where the `SMSBomber.jar` file is located and execute the following command:

```shell
~/SMSBomber java -jar SMSBomber.jar
```

## Example Config
For a POST request:
```json
{
  "name": "Example Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "method": "POST",
  "withOutZero": false,
  "repeat": 1,
  "payload": {
    "cellphone": "%phone_number%"
  }
}
```
Alternatively:
```json
{
  "name": "Example Name",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "method": "POST",
  "withOutZero": false,
  "repeat": 1,
  "payload": "cellphone: %phone_number%"
}
```

For a GET request:
```json
{
  "name": "Example Name",
  "url": "https://example.com/?phone=%phone_number%",
  "method": "GET",
  "withOutZero": false,
  "repeat": 1
}
```

## Notes:
If you want to remove the leading zero from the phone number, set the following option to `true`:
```
"withOutZero": true
```
If you want to forcibly set `ContentType`, add the following option:
```
"forceContentType": "application/json"
```
```
"forceContentType": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

## PlaceHolders:
Default phone number format:
```
%phone_number%
```
Customized phone number format (e.g., inserting - between digits):

```
%phone_number_<1><2><3><4>%-%phone_number_<5><6><7>%-%phone_number_<8><9><10><11>%
```
Example output:
```
0911-000-0000
```

Alternatively:
```
%phone_number_<1><2><3><4>% TEST %phone_number_<8><9><10>%
```
Example output:
```
0911 TEST 000
```
